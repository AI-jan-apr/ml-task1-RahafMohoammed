# Breast Cancer — Binary Classification
**By: Rahaf Mohammed**

---

## What I Did
Built and compared 3 machine learning models to predict whether a tumor is **malignant (0)** or **benign (1)** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.

---

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

---

## Results

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.96     | 0.96      | 0.99   | 0.97     |
| SVM                 | 0.93     | 0.92      | 0.97   | 0.95     |
| KNN                 | 0.91     | 0.94      | 0.92   | 0.93     |

## Conclusion
**Logistic Regression** performed best across all metrics.

In a medical context, **Recall is the most important metric** because missing a malignant tumor is far more dangerous than a false alarm.
